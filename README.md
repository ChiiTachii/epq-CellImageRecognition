# epq-CellImageRecognition
 This is the programming hub for my EPQ artefact on using Machine Learning to Identify Blood Cells utilising ResNet-50 technology.

 Each section is self explanatory (hopefully).

 Within the model folder, the files for my model as well as the different versions that I have trained and saved.

 The automated program I created for training model is also there within the run.py file.

 Within the images folder, the dataset I use is stored - separated into 3 different sections: Training, Testing and Test-simple (which I will be using for validation).
